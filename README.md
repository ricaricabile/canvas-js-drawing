# DrawingApp

To use this application download fontawesome in this website > https://fontawesome.com/download 
I included an image in this directory it is the fontawesome page see the red box in the image.
please view to avoid confusion
and modify html href as the version of the fontawesome updates in the future but now it is "6.1.1"

after downloading fontawesome, extract it in the root directory of this project

After that is finish open parts.html in your web browser it should show you two rows on the top of screen
and a gray area where you will be able to draw.

Click on any of the tools on the first row and your desired color on the second row,
then hover your mouse on the gray area and click it. A rectangle, circle, line, 
strokes will be drawn based on the tools and colors you choose.

also see DrawingApp.png it is application screenshot you should yield the same
User interface in your own project.
